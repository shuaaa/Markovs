Why Now
There has been a lot of failed attempt previously to build a local technology that can simplify and solve this laborious work. However due to the lack of Technological know in a local context, lack of capacity and information technology infrastructure, and research funding that supports quick implementation and reliability. We have successfully overcome this barrier. We have spent several years combined with industry experience with a tested and validated results proffer a working solution.
We bring state of the Art Technology to bear the services. A service that can contend with contemporaries around the world. A premier product that will radically change how things are done.

Context
Huge time savings and simplicity and innovation are the main benefit. The offering is for students, researchers, writers and journalist who are tasked with interviewing people and need to rewrite the interview in text format apt to publish.

A lot of time spent in collecting qualitative data mostly done through recording leads to hundreds of thousands of hours around the world spent on transcribing. This offering will immediately save users a huge amount of time. Although sophisticated the use of the services is simple and straight forward. The service comes as a web App and is accessible on mobile and web. 
Students of Journalism, social sciences, media and comms, theology, and engineering can use the services.  At this stage the users only have to sign up and immediately begin to use the services. The student will be able to immediate invite another person to start accruing free credits. The user may also choose not to invite a new and wait until initial free credits are depletes.
